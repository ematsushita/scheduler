# Interview Scheduler
A simple, single-page application built using React. Users can switch between weekdays and book an interview in an empty appointment slot - the number of available spots will update dynamically. Interviews are booked by typing in a student name and clicking on an interviewer from a list of available interviewers. Users can then cancel and interview or edit details on an existing interview.
